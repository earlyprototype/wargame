"""Headless integration tests for the interactive turn loop.

These drive the *real* CLI (``python -m cli.main play``) through scripted
stdin, exactly the way a player (or CI pipe) would. They exist because the
turn-idempotence bugs they cover previously survived CI, which only smoke-
tested ``--help``:

- cancelling out of the decision phase must not re-apply the turn briefing's
  scripted inject effects;
- loading a save (autosave or a mid-turn named save) must replay briefing
  context WITHOUT re-applying its effects, so repeated loads of the same
  save are deterministic.

Mechanics this relies on (see cli/keyboard.py): on non-TTY stdin the
"Press SPACE" pacing gates pass through without consuming stdin, so piped
lines map 1:1 onto real prompts (the four numeric setup menus, the ``>``
discussion prompt, the ``Decision>`` prompt, and any in-briefing
diplomatic-response prompt).

Metrics are asserted from the JSON save files (``world.metrics``) rather
than scraped from ANSI output. Runs use the deterministic mock LLM driver
(WARGAME_LLM=mock) and the default seed (42), so results are reproducible.

The game always writes saves to <repo>/saves/ (the path is derived from the
package location and cannot be redirected), so the module fixture moves any
pre-existing saves directory aside and restores it afterwards.

Each full game run takes roughly 20-60 seconds in mock mode; the module
runs the game four times total, shared across all tests via a
module-scoped fixture.
